## Project Overview

This is a project to build a cheap mixed signal defined radio, giving students the ability to build analog baseband circutits from op amps to filter baseband signals from the transivers IQ downconverter on the MAX2831. The Baseband Conversion stage is interfaced by the MAX5864, which has ADC and DAC IQ and balanced line ports. This board can take an external analog daughtercard to essentially add an external transfer funciton in the signal path.
